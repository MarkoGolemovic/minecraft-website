            <h1>INFLUENCES</h1>
            <p>
                There are many different things that inspired Minecraft. From a wide variety of past games, to different landscapes in the real world.
                The real question is though: how did Minecraft really come about?
                <br><br>
                Notchâ€™s main inspiration was a game known as Dwarf Fortress.
                <br>
                <img src="../assets/dwarf.png" alt="a screenshot of the original Dwarf Fortress that Notch was inspired by" class="screenshot">
                <br>
                This is a game where your goal is to build and manage a fortress of dwarves from the planets floor using the materials that were available to you.
                This was no ordinary game though. It was a text-based game where spiders were the letter S rather than being a detailed model, the floor was yellow crosses, and so on.
                <br>
                It was a difficult and complex game with often unpredictable results.
                <br><br>
                Notch also wanted his new game to be a fusion of the game Infiniminer, and one of his own prototypes, RubyDung. Infiniminer is also a game which utilizes blocks as its primary way of painting the world, and RubyDung utilized pixelated graphics.
                <br>
                <img src="../assets/infiniminer.png" alt="a screenshot from Infiniminer" class="screenshot">
                <img src="../assets/rubydung.jpg" alt="a screenshot of RubyDung" class="screenshot">
                <br>
                This is how Notch came across the brilliant idea of making a first-person game, set in a world of blocks and chunky pixel graphics, where
                the player would have full control of their world and its end result, with more in-depth models and entities for players to interact with. The spark in his mind got him working nonstop after work, trying to make his dream of creating his first serious game come true.
                <br><br>
                His hard work paid off, as Minecraft has now become one of the most beloved and best selling sandbox video games of all time.
