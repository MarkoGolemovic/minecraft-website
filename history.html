            <h1>HISTORY</h1>
            <p>
                There were many different aspects and processes that went in developing this game. Both from the coding aspects and design elements that were implemented into the game.
                <br>
                Notch wanted to get a proper point of view and turn his game into one with a first person perspective view. However, it was deemed to be more challenging than he expected and he was not happy with the results he was getting.
                He later started reusing some art and code from RubyDung which greatly aided in his game creation and sped up the process.
                <br><br>
                A few months down the line he strongly felt that he would not be able to complete the game unless he released an alpha version that was paid. This helped him in gaining
                the funds he needed to continue creating the game known as Minecraft today. The alpha sales began on June 13th 2009 and in less than a month it had sold over 1,000 copies and gained over 20,000 registered players.
                <br>
                Therefore, he decided to work less on his day job and focus more on spending his hours developing the game under the Mojang specifications banner.
                Later on when the game was further developed he came to the conclusion that he was able to leave his day job when there were over registered paid accounts. This was just the beginning and now the game is one of the most well known
                in the industry.
                <br><br>
                In 2014, Mojang and Minecraft were sold to Microsoft for 2.5 billion dollars, after which Notch stopped working on the game. After the sale Minecraft has acquired many more complex updates and is still being updated to this day, still holding the title of one of the greatest, most influential video games ever.
